Hello! I'm a student studying EECS and Business at UC Berkeley. Interested in AI/ML infrastructure and building powerful, performant AI-enabled applications. Currently working on a code search tool built in Golang, a lightweight serverless inference framework for Python. In the past, I've built a semantic search application for web data, worked for a few startups, and dabbled in AI research.
