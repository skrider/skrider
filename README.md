## Hi there!

I see you have found my Github profile. It may be small, but it's growing larger every week! I hope you find something of interest, whatever you may be looking for.

### About Me

I'm a student currently at UC Berkeley studying EECS and Business. As an engineer, I'm interested in constructing simple yet elegant systems that improve peoples' lives in a non-negligible way. As an entrepreneur, I'm interested in getting 
these systems and ideas to as many people as can benefit from them as possible. I'm especially interested in building web-based productivity tools (ask me about my Notion setup).
