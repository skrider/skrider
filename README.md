### Hi There!

I'm a student currently at UC Berkeley studying EECS and Business. As an engineer, I'm interested in constructing simple yet elegant systems that improve peoples' lives in a non-negligible way. As an entrepreneur, I'm interested in getting 
these systems and ideas to as many people as can benefit from them as possible. I'm especially interested in developer and personal productivity tools (ask me about my setup!).
