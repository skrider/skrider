Hello! I'm a student studying EECS and Business at UC Berkeley. Interested in AI/ML infrastructure and building powerful, performant AI-enabled applications. I'm currently working on a code search tool built in Golang and a lightweight serverless inference framework for kubernetes. In the past, I've built a semantic search application for web data (check it out at [trydocent.ai](https://www.trydocent.ai)) and worked for a few startups.
